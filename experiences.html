        First Year Research<br>
        December 2023

        Recently, I completed my the 3 semester FRI program offered at Binghamton University. 
        During my time in the FRI program, my group of five other people explored the biases presented in tech. 
        Specifically, we delve into the racial biases present in facial recognition(FR). 
        After identifying the flaws of FR, we assembled a neural network that identified faces more accurate than current models. 
        Our findings and improvements were presented in a three thousand word paper and at a poster expo along with other FRI students, professors and faculty.

        In Fall 2023, I joined the Girls Who Code chapter at Binghamton as a Teaching Instructor. 
        During this role, I taught middle school and high school girls web development. 
        I'm pleased to say that in Spring 2024, I accepted the position as Vice President of Programming Shadow. 
        This semester I will be shadowing the current VP of Programming with the plan of becoming the VP of Programming in Fall 2024.

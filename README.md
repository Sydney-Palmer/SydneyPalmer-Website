I put my HTML and CSS skills towards this personal project in order to make a portfolio. 
This portfolio is in the form of a website that is deployed using GitHub Pages.
It highlights academic achievements, courses and other projects I develop.
The website is intended to evolve as I expand my web development skillset.

        This website showcases my HTML and CSS skills that I earned through my experiences with GWC and CS50x. As I develop additional projects and gain more experience, they will be added to the website. This website will include more features as I hone in on my web development skillset.
        Essentially, this website tracks the growth in my academic career and coding capabilites.

        Habit Tracker<br>
        December 2022

    <div id = "experience-txt">
        To round out CS 110 my partner and I created a project that encompasses the topics taught throughout the course. We created a habit tracker using Python's Pygame.
        The project applies JSON files and additional python libraries in order to allow users to track the progress of habits inputted by them.
